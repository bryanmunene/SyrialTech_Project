SYRIATEL PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS OF CUSTOMER CHURN
1. Business Understanding
1.1. Introduction
SyriaTel, a telecommunications company bases in Damascus Syria, encounters a notable obstacle in curtailing customer churn, which can detrimentally affect its revenue and overall profitability. Customer churn denotes the situation where customers terminate their subscriptions with a company, frequently transitioning to competitors or discontinuing the service entirely. Notably, poor service experience and customer service are among the primary contributors to customer churn. Additionally, the ease with which customers can switch providers and encountering subpar customer experiences, such as requiring multiple contacts for issue resolution, also significantly contribute to churn rates. These factors underscore the criticality of focusing on service quality and enhancing customer satisfaction to effectively diminish the churn rate.

This includes improving service quality, enhancing customer support, and offering tailored solutions to address customer needs.
